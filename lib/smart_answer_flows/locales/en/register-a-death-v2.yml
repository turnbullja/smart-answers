        Find out how to register a death in the UK or abroad.

        - the person [died in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/death-and-bereavement/death-and-bereavement-what-to-do-when-someone-dies/registering-a-death.htm)

          You should register the death within 5 days.

          You can go to any [register office](/register-offices) but if you use the one in the area where the person died you’ll be given the documents you’ll need on the day.

          If you use a different register office the documents will be sent to the office in the area where the person died before they’re issued to you. This means you’ll usually wait a few days.

          ^Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.^

          If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales to be buried or cremated, the person bringing the body back must report this to the local registrar. They will issue a ‘Certificate of No Liability to Register’.

        who_can_register: |
          Who can register the death
          --------

          You can register the death if you’re:

          - someone present at the death

          - the person making arrangements with the funeral directors

        what_you_need_to_do_expected: |
          What you need to do
          --------

          Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you.

          If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

          - marriage or civil partnership certificate

          Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you.

          If the cause of death is unknown, sudden or unexplained it may be reported to the coroner.

          The coroner will give you the documents you need, or they’ll send them direct to the registrar. The table below shows the documents needed.

          Cause of death | Documents issued by coroner
          - | -
          Natural causes | Form 100A, or Pink Form 100B if there's a post-mortem - these forms are sent to the  registrar, but sometimes given to you
          Unnatural causes/not enough evidence of natural causes | Order for Burial (form 101) or Certificate for Cremation (form 6) so the funeral can take place – will be given to you; Certificate After Inquest (form 99 (rev)) - this states the cause of death and is sent to the registrar (the death is registered by the registrar with no-one present)

          ###If form 100A or 100B is issued (ie there is no inquest)

          If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

          - the full name, date of birth and occupation of a surviving or late spouse or civil partner
          - whether they were getting a State Pension or any other benefits

          - you can order a consular death registration certificate

          You will need to:

          s1. Check that you have the right documents.
          s2. Print out and fill in the forms.
          s3. Pay online.
          s4. Post your documents and the forms.

          - written permission from the person’s next of kin or the executor of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

          %Your application will be rejected if the documents aren’t authentic, don’t confirm the person’s identity or don’t prove that they were a British national when they died. The registration fee won’t be refunded.%
